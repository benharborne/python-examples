# Graphics by Jonn Zelle

(`"graphics"` aka `"graphics.py"` aka `"zelle-graphics"`)

Home Page: [Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/)

There are links to three editions which have a little different code. Some functions from one edition don't exist in another.

I use [Third Edition](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/ppics3/index.html) (v.5)

`Graphics` use `Tkinter` in background which has more usefull functions. But you have access to this functions too.
