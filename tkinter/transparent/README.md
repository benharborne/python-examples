# Transparent

Tkinter can make transparent windows with all widgets.

![#1](images/transparent.png?raw=true)   

But it can't make transparent only window and keep solid widgets.

And it can't make transparent one widget and keep solid window (and other widgets).

BTW: if you need text (without backgroun) on top of image then you can't put Label with text on Label with image.
But you can use Canvas to put image and text without backgroud (or PNG image without background).
