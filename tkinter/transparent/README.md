# Transparent

`Tkinter` can make transparent window with all widgets.

![#1](images/transparent.png?raw=true)   

But it can't make transparent only window and keep solid widgets.

And it can't make transparent one widget and keep solid window (and other widgets).

BTW: if you need text (without background) on top of image then you can't put Label with text on Label with image.

But you can use Canvas with image and with text without backgroud (or with PNG image without background).
