You can use `Radiobuttons` as normal `Buttons` but still you can select only one button.

You have to use `indicatoron=0`

```python
    tk.Radiobutton( ... , indicatoron=0)
``` 

| Before select any button<br/>or after click "Reset" |
| --- |
| ![#1](images/screenshot-1.png?raw=true) |

| Select first button |
| --- |
| ![#1](images/screenshot-2.png?raw=true) |

| Select second button<br>(first button unselected) |
| --- |
| ![#1](images/screenshot-3.png?raw=true) |
