**2017.12.17:** oryginal code from my answer to question on Stackoverflow.com: [Scraping reviews from tripadvisor](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47858268/1832058)

**2018.05.05:** tripadvisor.com changed some elements on page so old code doesn't work. I made some changes but not all elements are working yet.
