This page use JavaScript to put data on page.

Using DevTool in Chrome/Firefox you can see which urls use JavaScript to get this data from server (tab Network, filter XHR)

And then you can try to get the data too.

Code generate urls for 10 pages with JSON data and download them, 
save in separated files, generate full urls to image and Scrapy download them to subfolder full. 

Scrapy also save in output.json all yield data about downloaded images.
