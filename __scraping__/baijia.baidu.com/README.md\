It seems this sever sends file with string favicon.ico if you have incorrect USER-AGENT

Try with extra option which looks like correct USER-AGENT and you get HTML file.

    scrapy shell -s USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0" https://baijia.baidu.com

And then response.xpath will work.

In [1]: response.xpath('/html/head/title/text()').extract_first()
Out[1]: '首页-百家号'

You can get better USER-AGENT from your browser using page httpbin.org
