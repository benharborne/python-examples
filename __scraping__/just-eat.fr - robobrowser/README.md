Server may send page with `<iframe>` which has message about blocking for security reason.

Server needs correct `User Agent`.

If it still sends `<iframe>` then you can load the same page again.

It may works because request will have all cookies from previous request.

You can also load page from `<iframe>` to behave like real browser.
