This page uses JavaScript to display data but it doesn't use AJAX to read them.
It has all data in `HTML` as `JSON` in `<script type="application/json">` 

After converting adn digging in JSON you can get all information without scraping.

Parsers `lxml` and `html.parser` had problem to parse it but it works with `html5lib`.
