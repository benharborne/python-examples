Every link "Phone - click to View" has number in attribute onclick (ie. contactDetails( this, 154513 )) which JavaScript uses to get number from server using always the same url with this number - ie. https://www.cv-library.co.uk/account-contact-details?id=1545‌​13.

It works for awhile - probably I reached the click's limit :)
